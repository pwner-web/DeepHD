# Model Directory

The `model` directory within this repository serves as a storage location for trained machine learning models in PyTorch format. These models are trained and saved during the execution of the main program for various tasks such as gene expression prediction from single-cell datasets.

## Contents:

- **Model.pth**: This file contains the trained PyTorch model saved in a binary format using the `.pth` extension. The model architecture, weights, and other parameters necessary for inference are stored within this file.

## Usage:

These trained models can be loaded into memory using PyTorch's functionality for model loading. Once loaded, they can be used for various purposes such as prediction, evaluation, or further fine-tuning depending on the requirements of the specific application.
