# Data Directory

The `data` directory within this repository serves as a repository for datasets used in the main program. These datasets typically consist of gene expression matrices obtained from single-cell sequencing experiments and are utilized for training and evaluation of machine learning models.

## Contents:

- **HD_transformed_data.csv**: This CSV file contains transformed gene expression data related to Huntington's disease (HD). It serves as an example dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models implemented in the main program.

- *(Other datasets)*: Additional datasets related to gene expression matrices from single-cell sequencing experiments may be included in this directory for specific tasks or experiments.

## Usage:

Users can utilize the datasets stored in this directory for training, testing, and evaluating machine learning models implemented in the main program. The datasets can be loaded into memory using appropriate data loading functions and processed as needed for model training and evaluation tasks.
